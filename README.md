# IRRI-OneRice-Simulation
The IRRI breeding program has initiated an optimization process in its strategy to develop modern rice varieties by incorporating faster breeding techniques along with genomic selection to increase the rate of genetic gain while shortening the time it takes.
The main objective of this simulation was to evaluate the performance of the OneRice breeding schemes according to the parents' recycling length and the impact of genomic selection.
